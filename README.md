# Dibs-Check
A shell script to email you when a Evanced D!BS Room Reservation is made.

The library I work for started using Evanced's D!BS, but we were troubled that there was no notification when a reservation was made. This script uses the D!BS API, documented here http://kb.evanced.info/article.php?id=480 , to fetch the a specific room's reservations for the current day and then email them when a new on is added.
